# In-container PinchBench entrypoint, baked into the image at /opt/run_task.sh (see
# Dockerfile.benchmark). Runs the stock PinchBench benchmark.py for a SINGLE task
# through OpenClaw and tars its results to <BASE>/out/out.tgz so the host can pull
# them back via the Sandbox API. The skill lives at /opt/pinchbench-skill (cloned at
# a pinned tag + NVIDIA-patched at image build).
#
# One sandbox per task = the isolation boundary (own filesystem -> own ~/.openclaw ->
# own gateway), so the gateway never shares a workspace across tasks (no
# WorkspaceVanishedError cliff). Provider-neutral (apptainer / opensandbox).
#
# WHY everything lives under $BASE (the Sandbox API working mount, default /sandbox):
# under the apptainer provider the image rootfs is READ-ONLY and /tmp + $HOME are the
# *host's* dirs SHARED across concurrent instances -- only the per-sandbox bind at the
# provider mount_point (/sandbox) is both writable AND isolated. So we point the skill
# copy, OpenClaw's $HOME, $TMPDIR and benchmark.py's run-root all under $BASE. (Under
# opensandbox the rootfs is writable anyway, so $BASE is just a private working dir.)
