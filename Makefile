# NeMo Gym — top-level convenience targets.
# Fern docs targets live at the root so contributors don't have to remember
# the exact `cd fern && npx … fern-api` invocations. CI workflows under
# `.github/workflows/fern-docs-*.yml` are the source of truth for the
# published pipeline; these targets just mirror the local-developer entry
# points.
#
# First time on this machine? Run `make docs-login` before `make docs`.
# Without dashboard provisioning, `fern docs md generate` fails with
# `HTTP 403: User does not belong to organization`.

# First-time auth setup. Fern's CLI requires that the user already exist in
# Fern's user DB *before* `fern login` can complete; signing in to the
# dashboard is what creates that user record. Skipping step 1 below leaves
# the CLI login prompt with no working path forward (you can't get past the
# email entry), and skipping it before `fern docs md generate` returns:
#
#     HTTP 403: User does not belong to organization
#
# This target blocks on a confirmation prompt so step 1 isn't accidentally
# skipped. (Tracked upstream at Fern; ping #fern-cli on Slack if it changes.)
